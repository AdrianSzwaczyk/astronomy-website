                        						The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect
                        ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.
                        The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation,
                        and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
                        						The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that
                        of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of
                        the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists
                        of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities
                        of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
                        						The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and
                        not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white).
                        It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter
                        within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
                        whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The
                        central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in
                        its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
                        						Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium,
                        and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which
                        can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the
                        Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point
                        at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a
                        marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually
                        transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently
                        large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable
                        – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers
                        and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce
                        energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.
                        						The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric
                        times. The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of
                        Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars. The predominant
                        calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century
                        interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.

                        						Proxima Centauri is a small, low-mass star located 4.2465 light-years (1.3020
                        pc) away from the Sun in the southern constellation of Centaurus. Its Latin name means
                        the 'nearest star of Centaurus'. It was discovered in 1915 by Robert Innes and is
                        the nearest-known star to the Sun. With a quiescent apparent magnitude of 11.13, it
                        is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. Proxima Centauri is a member of the
                        Alpha Centauri star system, being identified as component Alpha Centauri C, and is
                        2.18° to the southwest of the Alpha Centauri AB pair. It is currently 12,950 AU (0.2
                        ly) from AB, which it orbits with a period of about 550,000 years.
                        						Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star with a mass about 12.5% of the Sun's mass
                        (M☉), and average density about 33 times that of the Sun. Because of Proxima Centauri's
                        proximity to Earth, its angular diameter can be measured directly. Its actual diameter
                        is about one-seventh (14%) the diameter of the Sun. Although it has a very low average
                        luminosity, Proxima Centauri is a flare star that randomly undergoes dramatic increases
                        in brightness because of magnetic activity. The star's magnetic field is created by
                        convection throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates
                        a total X-ray emission similar to that produced by the Sun. The internal mixing of
                        its fuel by convection through its core, and Proxima's relatively low energy-production
                        rate, mean that it will be a main-sequence star for another four trillion years.
                        						Proxima Centauri has two known exoplanets and one candidate exoplanet: Proxima
                        Centauri b, Proxima Centauri d and the disputed Proxima Centauri c. Proxima Centauri
                        b orbits the star at a distance of roughly 0.05 AU (7.5 million km) with an orbital
                        period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its estimated mass is at least 1.17 times
                        that of Earth. Proxima b orbits within Proxima Centauri's habitable zone—the range
                        where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on its surface—but, because
                        Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf and a flare star, the planet's habitability is highly
                        uncertain. A candidate super-Earth, Proxima Centauri c, orbits roughly 1.5 AU (220
                        million km) away every 1,900 d (5.2 yr). A sub-Earth, Proxima Centauri d, orbits roughly
                        0.029 AU (4.3 million km) away every 5.1 days.

                        <p>
                           							Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
                           Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
                           It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of
                           the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes.
                           Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and
                           its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity
                           to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset
                           or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear
                           as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth,
                           the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus
                           and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. The
                           synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes Mercury most of the time Earth's closest
                           planet, despite Venus at times approaching Earth closer than any other planet can.
                           							Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally
                           locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed
                           stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes
                           around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the
                           orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer
                           on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
                           							Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about
                           1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the
                           Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds
                           (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and
                           is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
                           for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface
                           temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System,
                           ranging from 100 K (-173 °C; -280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the
                           day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93
                           °C; −136 °F). The planet has no natural satellites.
                           							Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and
                           MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before
                           exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015. The
                           BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.

                           							Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister"
                           or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior
                           planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun,
                           either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the
                           brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth
                           at dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
                           							Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System, with a
                           surface gravity minimally lower than on Earth, but having only an induced magnetosphere.
                           The carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus is the densest of the four terrestrial planets.
                           The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure
                           of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though
                           Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar
                           System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an
                           opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the planet with
                           the highest albedo in the Solar System and preventing its surface from being seen
                           from Earth in light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but after these evaporated
                           the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated,
                           and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because
                           of the lack of an internally induced magnetic field. At roughly 50 km above the surface
                           atmospheric conditions reach Earth-like temperatures and levels of pressure. The possibility
                           of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation but convincing evidence has
                           yet to be found.                                    
                           							Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among
                           the planets in the Solar System. Solar days on Venus, with a length of 117 Earth days,
                           are just about half as long as its solar year, orbiting the Sun every 224.7 Earth
                           days. This Venusian daylength is a product of it rotating against its orbital motion,
                           halving its full sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days, the longest of all the
                           Solar System planets. Venus and Uranus are the only planets with such a retrograde
                           rotation, making the Sun move in their skies from their western horizon to their eastern.
                           The orbit of Venus around the Sun is the closest to Earth's orbit, allowing them to
                           approach each other at inferior conjunction closer than any other planet, at a synodic
                           period of 1.6 years, while Mercury approaches them more often the closest. The close
                           orbit of Venus and Earth furthermore results in the lowest gravitational potential
                           difference and lowest delta-v needed to transfer from them to any other planet.  
                           
                           							This has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It
                           was the first planet beyond Earth spacecrafts were sent to, starting with Venera 1
                           in 1961, and the first planet to be reached, impacted and in 1970 successfully landed
                           on by Venera 7. As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major
                           fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred
                           to gods of many cultures, gaining its mainly used name from the Roman goddess of love
                           and beauty which it is associated with. Furthermore it has been a prime inspiration
                           for writers, poets and scholars. Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted
                           across the sky, as early as the second millennium BCE. Plans for better exploration
                           with rovers or atmospheric missions, potentially crewed, at levels with almost Earth-like
                           conditions have been proposed.

                           							Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known
                           to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System,
                           only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up
                           of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of
                           Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer
                           is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain
                           ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic
                           field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.
                           							Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases
                           in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun
                           close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds
                           that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than
                           polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's
                           climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating
                           oceans. In most areas severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and
                           heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.
                           							Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest
                           planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most
                           massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking
                           a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own
                           axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis
                           of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around
                           the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the
                           Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter
                           as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal
                           locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
                           							Earth, like most other Solar System bodies formed 4.5 billion years ago from
                           gas of the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history the
                           ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to
                           affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion
                           years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost
                           8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their
                           survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact
                           on Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's
                           lives and causing widespread extinction of other life.

                           							Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
                           It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other
                           planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass
                           of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky
                           after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was
                           named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.
                           							Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter
                           of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements,
                           but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid
                           surface. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it
                           receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate
                           spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere
                           is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their
                           interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
                           storm which has been observed since at least 1831.
                           							Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere.
                           Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU; 500 million mi) long, covering
                           nearly the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly
                           many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io,
                           Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the size of Earth's Moon;
                           Callisto is almost the size of the planet Mercury, and Ganymede is larger.
                           							Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach
                           to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored by multiple robotic
                           spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979,
                           and later with the Galileo orbiter in 1995. In 2007, the New Horizons visited Jupiter
                           using its gravity to increase its speed, bending its trajectory en route to Pluto.
                           The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.
                           Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered
                           liquid ocean of Europa.

                           							Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar
                           System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and
                           a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however,
                           with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
                           							Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock
                           (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic
                           hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally,
                           a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its
                           upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought
                           to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but
                           which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's
                           magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere
                           is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.
                           Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter
                           but not as high as on Neptune.
                           							The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed
                           mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least
                           83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not
                           include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the
                           second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less
                           massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

                           							Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek
                           god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather
                           of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has
                           the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
                           System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions
                           which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason,
                           scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from
                           the other giant planets.
                           							As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's
                           atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen
                           and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along
                           with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the
                           Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex,
                           layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane
                           the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and
                           rock.
                           							Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and
                           numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of
                           rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and
                           south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986,
                           images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light,
                           without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager
                           2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet. Observations from Earth have shown
                           seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in
                           2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                        						The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest modular space station currently
                        in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating
                        space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe),
                        and CSA (Canada). The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental
                        treaties and agreements. The station serves as a microgravity and space environment
                        research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy,
                        meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is suited for testing the spacecraft
                        systems and equipment required for possible future long-duration missions to the Moon
                        and Mars.
                        						The ISS programme evolved from the Space Station Freedom, a 1984 American proposal
                        to construct a permanently crewed Earth-orbiting station, and the contemporaneous
                        Soviet/Russian Mir-2 proposal from 1976 with similar aims. The ISS is the ninth space
                        station to be inhabited by crews, following the Soviet and later Russian Salyut, Almaz,
                        and Mir stations and the American Skylab. It is the largest artificial object in the
                        solar system and the largest satellite in low Earth orbit, regularly visible to the
                        naked eye from Earth's surface. It maintains an orbit with an average altitude of
                        400 kilometres (250 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda
                        Service Module or visiting spacecraft. The ISS circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes,
                        completing 15.5 orbits per day.
                        						The station is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS)
                        is operated by Russia, while the United States Orbital Segment (USOS) is run by the
                        United States as well as by the other states. The Russian segment includes six modules.
                        The US segment includes ten modules, whose support services are distributed 76.6%
                        for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA and 2.3% for CSA.
                        						Roscosmos had previously endorsed the continued operation of ROS through 2024,
                        having proposed using elements of the segment to construct a new Russian space station
                        called OPSEK. However, continued cooperation has been rendered uncertain by the 2022
                        Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions on Russia, who
                        theoretically, may lower, redirect, or cut funding from their side of the space station
                        due to the sanctions set on them.
                        						The first ISS component was launched in 1998, and the first long-term residents
                        arrived on 2 November 2000 after being launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 31
                        October 2000. The station has since been continuously occupied for 22 years and 18
                        days, the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, having surpassed the
                        previous record of 9 years and 357 days held by the Mir space station. The latest
                        major pressurised module, Nauka, was fitted in 2021, a little over ten years after
                        the previous major addition, Leonardo in 2011. Development and assembly of the station
                        continues, with an experimental inflatable space habitat added in 2016, and several
                        major new Russian elements scheduled for launch starting in 2021. In January 2022,
                        the station's operation authorization was extended to 2030, with funding secured within
                        the United States through that year. There have been calls to privatize ISS operations
                        after that point to pursue future Moon and Mars missions, with former NASA Administrator
                        Jim Bridenstine stating: "given our current budget constraints, if we want to go to
                        the moon and we want to go to Mars, we need to commercialize low Earth orbit and go
                        on to the next step."
                        						The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, photovoltaic
                        solar arrays, thermal radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.
                        Major ISS modules have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets and US Space
                        Shuttles. The station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft: the Russian
                        Soyuz and Progress, the SpaceX Dragon 2, and the Northrop Grumman Space Systems Cygnus,
                        and formerly the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the Japanese H-II Transfer
                        Vehicle, and SpaceX Dragon 1. The Dragon spacecraft allows the return of pressurised
                        cargo to Earth, which is used, for example, to repatriate scientific experiments for
                        further analysis. As of April 2022, 251 astronauts, cosmonauts, and space tourists
                        from 20 different nations have visited the space station, many of them multiple times.

                        						Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of
                        the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System and interstellar space beyond
                        the Sun's heliosphere. Launched 16 days after its twin Voyager 2, Voyager 1 has been
                        operating for 45 years, 2 months and 16 days as of November 21, 2022 UTC. It communicates
                        through NASA's Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data
                        to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data is provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance
                        of 158.79 AU (14.760 billion mi) from Earth as of November 7, 2022, it is the most
                        distant human-made object from Earth.
                        						The probe made flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan.
                        NASA had a choice of either doing a Pluto or Titan flyby; exploration of the moon
                        took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. Voyager 1 studied
                        the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe
                        to provide detailed images of their moons.
                        						As part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft Voyager 2, the spacecraft's
                        extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere
                        and to begin exploring the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause and
                        entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do
                        so. Two years later, Voyager 1 began experiencing a third "tsunami wave" of coronal
                        mass ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further
                        confirming that the probe is indeed in interstellar space.
                        						In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team tested
                        the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters in late 2017 (the
                        first time these thrusters had been fired since 1980), a project enabling the mission
                        to be extended by two to three years. Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to
                        continue until about 2025, when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)
                        will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments.
