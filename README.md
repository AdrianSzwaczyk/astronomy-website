# Website Project

![Main Page](.\Website\preview\main-page.png)

## Overview

This project is one of my earliest websites, focusing on visual effects and interactivity using mainly HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript. It incorporates features such as parallax scrolling, smooth transitions, and interactive galleries achieved with tricks and smart techniques instead of JavaScript.

It uses PHP and MongoDB for submitting a form, registering a new account and logging into existing one, but you would need to set up a server for those features to work.

## Folder Structure

```
Website/
│-- index.html          # Main page of the website
│-- other .html files   # You can get to them from main page
│-- .php files          # You would need a server to use them
│-- assets folders      # Folders containing CSS, scripts, images etc.

XML Project/  # A separate folder containing an XML-related project

XSLT Project/ # A folder dedicated to an XSLT transformation project
```

## Technologies Used
